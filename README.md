# 👋 Hi, I'm Olusunmbola Oluwasijibomi David (Sijibomi)

I'm a 17-year-old Software Engineer, UI Designer, and Author based in Nigeria. I build tools that blend utility with elegance, and I'm deeply interested in the intersection of logic, aesthetics, and storytelling.

Currently, I'm focused on frontend development with JavaScript and TypeScript, as well as designing developer-first experiences that are intuitive and efficient. I also write speculative fiction, where I explore themes like consciousness, memory, and simulation.

> I care about clarity, curiosity, and craft. Whether it's code or story, I'm always chasing the cleanest expression of an idea.

### 🧠 learning & life
i’m obsessed with building systems that help people think better — whether that’s through tools, interfaces, or fiction. i log my thinking in **anytype**, practice languages with **duolingo**, study science via **veritasium**, and challenge my mind on **brilliant.org**.

i believe in ideas that blur the line between tools and toys.
