# 👋 Hi, I'm Olusunmbola Oluwasijibomi David (Sijibomi)

I'm a 17-year-old Software Engineer, UI Designer, and Author based in Nigeria. I build tools that blend utility with elegance, and I'm deeply interested in the intersection of logic, aesthetics, and storytelling.

Currently, I'm focused on frontend development with JavaScript and TypeScript, as well as designing developer-first experiences that are intuitive and efficient. I also write speculative fiction, where I explore themes like consciousness, memory, and simulation.
