## hi, i’m sijibomi

i build small, opinionated tools, emphasis being on clarity, restraint, and finish.
most of my work sits at the intersection of frontend engineering and interface design.

i care a lot about **usable minimalism**: fewer but powerful features, sharper edges, better defaults.
currently focused on javascript/typescript and performance-conscious ui systems.

## selected projects

**supermouse v2**
a refined typescript cursor engine for advanced mouse interactions and ui control.
built with a strong focus on ergonomics, composability and real-world usage.
→ this is my most complete and representative work.

**prism** (formerly mathlly)
is a web-based math tool (with PWA support) built for speed with vue.js
developer-centric while being useful to math enthusiasts.

**pane**
a mobile utility app combining a flip clock, pomodoro, alarm, and stopwatch.
built with capacitor; designed as a single-purpose, low-distraction time tool.

**everyday**
a minimalist adhd-friendly task tracker.
deliberately avoids gamification and clutter in favor of frictionless capture.

*(older or experimental projects are archived for reference.)*
